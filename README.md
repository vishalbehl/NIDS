# Network Intrusion Detection System Using ML

The proposed work is implemented in Python 3.11 with libraries scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib and other mandatory libraries. We downloaded dataset from kdd.ics.uci.edu. The data downloaded contains train set and test set separately with four different classes of intrusions. The train dataset considered as train set and test dataset considered as test set. 
We have collected the dataset for the intrusion detection system with following details from KDD dataset. For our dataset we have selected various classification techniques such as:
 
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Decision Tree
3.	K-Nearest Neighbors
4.	Naive bayes Model
5.	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6.	Neural Network Model
